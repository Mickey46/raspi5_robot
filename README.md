# Raspberry Pi Motor Controller

This project demonstrates how to control motors using the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi with the help of the `gpiozero` library and the `curses` library for keyboard input. This setup allows you to control two motors to move forward, backward, turn left, and turn right based on keyboard inputs.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have the following:
- A Raspberry Pi with GPIO pins
- Two motors correctly connected to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins
- Python 3 installed on your Raspberry Pi
- `gpiozero` and `curses` libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install gpiozero
```
Hardware Setup

    Connect the forward, backward, and enable pins of Motor A to GPIO pins 22, 23, and 17 respectively.
    Connect the forward, backward, and enable pins of Motor B to GPIO pins 24, 25, and 27 respectively.
    Ensure your motors are powered and can handle the GPIO signal levels.

Software

This script provides the following functionality:

    Forward: Both motors will turn in the forward direction.
    Backward: Both motors will turn in the backward direction.
    Turn Left: Motor A moves forward while Motor B moves backward.
    Turn Right: Motor A moves backward while Motor B moves forward.
    Stop: Both motors will stop.
    Quit: Stops the motors and exits the program.

Running the Script

To run the script, execute the following command in the terminal:

bash

python motor_control.py

Controls

    s - Move forward
    w - Move backward
    d - Turn left
    a - Turn right
    SPACE - Stop the motors
    q - Quit the program

Safety Notice

Always ensure your Raspberry Pi is powered off when connecting or disconnecting motors to avoid any damage to the hardware.
